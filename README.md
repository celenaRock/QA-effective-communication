Hi engineering team,

It has been a year since we purchased employee management software from you guys. with every release this software is getting worse, what the heck are you guys doing there?? We are encountering so many bugs with your software that it makes our life a living hell. If you can’t build and test this piece of garbage you sell, please do us a favor and just stop making software. We requested a feature upgrade over a month ago and have seen no improvements or even a decent response. It is starting to feel like a big scam! We are ready to throw in the towel and buy what we need from someone else.

Sincerely,
You're about to lose a customer

John

## Response:
Hi John,

I’m sorry you’re having a bad time with our software. I want you know you’re a very important customer to us. Here are some steps I’d like to take to address your concerns:
1.	I’d like to meet with you or your representative at your earliest opportunity to make sure we are capturing all the bugs you’ve encountered.
2.	During that meeting let’s go over the feature upgrades you need so we can back to you as soon as possible with a timeline.
3.	After we’ve all got a clear idea of what’s wrong and what you still need, let’s set a date to get back together and measure progress.
Again, I’m very sorry we haven’t given you the employee management software you needed. I’m confident that together we can get things back on track.

Sincerely,

James Proctor

## Scenario One:

On average a QA Engineer at your company spends 3-4 hours a day on running manual test cases for a UI web application in addition to spending another 3-4 hours maintaining/updating test documents for the application. Every time there is a new update or a bug fix that needs to be released, it takes the QA engineer more than a week to complete regression testing of the application. What would you recommend in this situation?

## Response:

Boss,

Our Average QA Engineer is spending 3-4 hours a day running manual tests and another 3-4 hours doing the paperwork. Every time we field a new update or fix a bug, it takes more than a week to do the regression testing. 

There’s got to be a better way. 

Can we spend some time in the morning huddles getting to the bottom of what’s going on?

I suspect we could invest in better testing suites and training, but I’d like it if we could get buy-in first and build consensus on the direction to take.

Very Respectfully,

James

## Scenario Two:
Your company has recently made a switch and now everyone works from home. After a few days, you noticed individuals on the team are not very responsive to messages. The project is getting behind and the part you’re working on is blocked due to their lack of response. Current management has already made it a requirement for all employees to be “online” during hours recorded “on the clock” but many employees remain unresponsive. What could you do in this situation?

## Response:

Boss,

I’m blocked. 

Our whole team is working from home and therefore nominally on the clock, but several of them have disappeared. They don’t respond to messages.
The project is X days behind at this point, and if they don’t start getting on task, I fear we’ll start missing targets.
Can I get your help on this? If you have the time, I think either a Monday morning or Friday afternoon meeting where you kick things off would be very helpful for setting expectations.

Very respectfully,

James
